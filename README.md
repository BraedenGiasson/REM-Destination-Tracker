# REM Destination Tracker :link:

One of my first projects! It consists of entering a start and end date for the Montreal REM stations, as well as a starting date and time. 

Once you enter the trip information, it will generate a route from the start to the end station, showing each station along the way, as well as the arriving time to each station!
